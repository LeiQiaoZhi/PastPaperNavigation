I want to create a static webapp for navigation of past papers for computer science in Cambridge.

There are 2 main ways of navigation.
1. through course name. I want a dropdown to select the course, then there is a button which is a link to the course's past papers page. Users can type to search for the course.
2. through year + paper + question, the 3 numbers can be used to create an url. There are 2 buttons, one is for the paper url and the other for solution url.

I want to create web app using javascript and html and css.

I want the design and layout to be modern and clean and elegant.

Generate the required code.
